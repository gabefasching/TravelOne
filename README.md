# Inspiration
We were inspired to create TravelOne by the challenge placed by CapitalOne to reimagine banking.

# What it does
TravelOne is a website that allows CapitolOne users to sign in and view their discounts on trips they may want to take. We use newly developing AI technology to suggest locations to travel to, describe the city, and show it off with a generated image.

# How we built it
We build this app with the help of a Node.JS backend and a React frontend. We used PostMan to help with our API calls, and Bootstrap as a frontend framework. We programmed in JavaScript and Python. We were proud to use Chat-GPT 3.5 and Dall-e 2, which are both AI drive processing tools. Lastly, we used the CapitalOne Nessie API, Amadeus Flight API, API-Ninjas Geocoding API, GPT API, Dall-E API, and the CapitalOne Hotel API.

# Challenges we ran into
We were unfamiliar with all of the complexities that went into Capital One's Travel Software when we started. This led us to cut a few features. Thankfully, we were able to finish with a complete product thanks to Nessie API provided by CapitolOne.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of successfully implementing a full-stack web application with a strong back end and a pleasing front end. We're especially proud of the work we were able to do with the GPT software.

# What we learned
We learned a lot about CapitolOne's traveling benefits. We also learned a lot about what it takes to make a full-stack web application of this size.

# What's next for TravelOne
We hope to have the opportunity to work again and continue to expand. On the horizon, we look forward to implementing features such as price ranges, trip advisor recommendations, and maybe a more in-depth sign-in system.
